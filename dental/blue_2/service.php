				<p>General dentistry is the branch of medicine involving the care and prevention of oral health conditions, diseases and disorders. A dentist's job is to use preventative care and patient education to preclude the need for treatments and instead promote a healthy smile for life. Dentists are also responsible for diagnosing conditions that affect the mouth, teeth, gums and jaws, as well as develop the most effective treatment plan with the patient's best interests in mind.</p>
				<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/25.jpg"/></div>
<p>General dentists typically do not focus on any particular specialty, instead opting to provide generalized dental care to patients. In some cases, general dentists may refer a patient to a specialty provider for care or treatment that is beyond the scope of general dentistry. However, most general dentists are capable of providing complete examinations, cleanings, root canals, restorations, extractions and tooth prosthetics.</p>

<p>General dentistry is best when patients use it for preventive care, rather than for corrective treatment. By visiting a dentist and his or her team of hygienists and dental technicians twice annually for cleaning and examination, patients can avoid decay and identify potential oral health conditions, such as periodontal disease, in their earliest stages.	</p>

<h3>An Overview of Cosmetic Dentistry-</h3>

<p>A rapidly emerging field of dentistry is referred to as cosmetic dentistry. In cosmetic dentistry, the emphasis is on improving the patient's smile through changing the appearance of the teeth and mouth. Many people view cosmetic dental practices as being elective treatments – as opposed to necessary dental treatments – but having a beautiful, engaging smile and feeling secure in one's appearance can make people feel better about themselves and lead to a fuller, happier life. For an experienced Ghazipur cosmetic dentist, turn to the dental services of Shashi Shanti Dental and Oral Care Center.
How Cosmetic Dentistry Works-</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/Cosmetic-Procedures.jpg"/></div>
<p>Cosmetic dentistry is the best way to improve your smile, whether you've missing or damaged teeth, gaps between your teeth, or your teeth have been discolored or stained. Your cosmetic dentist in Ghazipur will offer all of their services in their comfortable dental office; you don't need to worry about being referred to additional specialists. This means our dentists at Shashi Shanti Dental and Oral Care Center will be overseeing and performing your cosmetic dental procedures, in a manner that is convenient to your schedule.</p>
<h3>Cosmetic Dentistry Treatments-</h3>

<strong>There are currently many cosmetic dentistry procedures available. Among these are:</strong>

<p>1.Composite Bonding – replaces the broken, chipped, and discolored parts of teeth through the use of a special composite material. Dental Implants – used to replace missing teeth, dental implants are artificial tooth root replacements.</p>

<p>2.Dental Veneers – adhesively bonded to the surface of a tooth or teeth to cover gaps, cracks, and chips in existing teeth and also to improve the color of the teeth.</p>

<p>3.Inlays or Onlays – inlays are also called indirect fillings; they are a long-lasting type of filling that is added to teeth with tooth decay or other structural damage.</p>

<p>4.Teeth Whitening – the most commonly recommended and practiced cosmetic dental procedure, tooth whitening removes stains on teeth; the cosmetic procedure can be performed at home or in your cosmetic dentist's office.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Sedation Dentistry</h2></div>
 <p>If you are considering IV sedation or general anesthesia for your next dental treatment, chances are you have some lingering questions about what you should expect.</p>

<p>Sedation and anesthesia are useful for a number of purposes. Specifically, complex procedures are shortened to a single appointment, as opposed to multiple procedures that are inconvenient and uncomfortable for the patient. Furthermore, sedation and anesthesia can help improve treatment efficacy in children and patients with special needs, and it can also help relieve worries among patients with previously negative dental experiences.</p>

<p>the majority of dental procedures are performed using local anesthetic for pain management. Also, some patients may exhibit certain health factors that prevent the safe administration of general anesthesia.</p>

<p>for patients deemed healthy enough for anesthesia or sedation. You are in good hands with an experienced dental anesthesiologist with many years of training. All of your vital signs are carefully monitored for the duration of your treatment. However, you will be given a set of strict instructions for use prior to and following your procedure. Adhering to these rules is paramount to ensuring a safe sedation or anesthesia experience.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/index.jpg"/></div>
<strong>My child will be undergoing anesthesia. Is there anything I should know?</strong>

<p>Yes. In addition to carefully following the pre-anesthetic instructions provided to you prior to your appointment, it is important that you explain to your child what he or she should expect on the day of the procedure. You will set the tone for your child's experience, so be sure to appear level-headed and confident – not anxious or frightened. Also, help your child feel secure by allowing him or her to bring a favorite toy or stuffed animal to the appointment.</p>

<strong>What should I expect upon arriving for my procedure?</strong>

<p>You may have paperwork to complete the day of your surgery. We ask that you arrive at least a half hour prior to your appointment. You will be asked about changes to your health since your pre-operative evaluation. So long as you are in good health and you followed all pre-operative instructions, the procedure will proceed as scheduled. You will not be allowed to operate a vehicle following your surgery, so you will need to arrange for someone to drive you to and from your appointment.</p>

<strong>Is a breathing tube necessary for my procedure?</strong>

<p>We are unable to determine whether you will need a breathing tube while under general anesthesia, as that decision is made on a patient-to-patient basis. In many cases, breathing tubes are not necessary, as dental anesthesia allows for the continuation of intermittent patient breathing.</p>

<strong>What will happen after I wake up?</strong>

<p>You will be released into the care of a responsible adult driver. You may have little or no memory of your experience and quite possibly will sleep much of the day. Rest is important when recovering from anesthesia, so try to arrange for assistance from a family member or other responsible adult for the first 24 hours after your surgery. </p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Cancer Screenings</h2></div>
				
				
<p> One of the most frequent and deadly types of cancer is oral cancer. Over the past fifty years, significant progress has been made in the area of diagnosing cancerous growths in most parts of the body such as the mammary glands and the prostate, but almost no progress had been been made in diagnosing oral cancer. This is significant because oral cancer is no less frequent than the previously mentioned cancers and the survival rate is an abysmal thirty percent. But help is on the way.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/featured-oral-cancer-screening.jpg"/></div>

<p>LED Dental has developed a device that has proven extremely effective in detecting oral cancer at its beginning stages. This device is known as the VELscope Vx. The VELscope VX uses a handpiece that shines a blue light into a patient's oral cavity. Abnormal tissue growth appears as a dark spot, with the surrounding healthy tissue appearing fluorescent.</p>

<p>Previously, diagnosis of oral abnormalities was done by the unassisted eye of a dental professional. While this was the most effective way of diagnosing a patient's condition, it was grossly ineffective in detecting oral cancer at its earliest stages. Without giving every patient who came into an office a biopsy, most patients with oral cancer were not diagnosed until the later stages of the disease when treatment options were limited and the rate of survival was significantly lower. However, now with the advent of VELscope VX, that inadequate detection process is a thing of the past.

            <div class="title"><h2>Crown and Bridges</h2></div>
				
				
<p>A crown (cap) is a restoration that is placed on teeth that have lost a lot of their structure. There are various types of crowns, ranging from full porcelain to full metal crowns. Your dentist will explain the advantages and disadvantages of each kind for you.</p>

<p>Crowns may also be used to securely attach a bridge if the structure of the surrounding teeth is inadequate. A bridge is a dental appliance that is used to replace one or more missing teeth. They are designed to be cosmetically appealing and to restore proper occlusion. Like crowns, bridges are fully customizable and made of various materials, including porcelain and metals. Although not as permanent as a cap, bridges are bonded to the surrounding teeth and only removable by your dentist.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/crowns-bridges.png"/></div>
<p>Both crowns and bridges are created to match the color, height, texture, and overall appearance of your teeth. Most crowns and bridges will last for life, eliminating the need to replace them unless they fall out or become loose. You may prolong the durability of your crowns and bridges by practicing good oral hygiene and visiting your dentist for regular check-ups and cleanings.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Teeth Whitening</h2></div>
				
			
 <p>Teeth stains are inevitable due to our consumption of a variety of foods and drinks (soda, spicy food, coffee, etc.). However, advanced teeth whitening technology has enabled dentists to whiten teeth without adversely affecting the tooth structure.
</p>
<p>Almost all whitening methods are similar in concept, but some are much more effective because of the way the whitening material is delivered to the teeth. Another contributing factor is the concentration of the material, which is why less potent over-the-counter whitening systems usually don't give patients the results they are hoping for.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/321061v2.jpg"/></div>
<p>The two main methods of professional whitening are tray whitening and in-office whitening. In tray whitening, an impression is taken and a custom tray is made for the patient. Then, a supply of whitening gel is given to the patient and he/she wears the tray for a few hours each day (techniques differ) for a period of time until an acceptable result is achieved. Sensitivity of the teeth is a normal side-effect of this whitening method and is almost always transitional.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, in-office whitening is the most efficient means of whitening. There are a number of different types used, but the process is very similar for these methods; you can have your teeth whitened in one session and achieve significant results. Your dentist can give you more detailed information and help you decide which method is more suitable for you and your teeth.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Tooth-Colored Fillings</h2></div>
				
				
<p> When considering tooth fillings, one of the options available is composite fillings which are made from durable plastics that are similar in color to natural teeth. Because the composite fillings are tooth-colored, they look more natural and are less noticeable compared to other types of fillings.Composite and Tooth Color Fillings, Cosmetic tooth fillings.</p>

<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/Tooth-Colored-Fillings.jpg"/></div>
<p>Another benefit of tooth-colored fillings is that they are compatible with sealants, allowing your dentist to perform both procedures in a single sitting and thus preventing further decay. There are other advantages to composite, tooth-colored fillings such as, most importantly, its ability to bond to tooth structures. Also, in many cases these fillings can be repaired by the addition of more composite material.
</p>
<p>Speak with one of our doctors to find out which kind of filling is best for you.

            <div class="title"><h2>Dental Implants</h2></div>
				
				
<p> During the last 20 years, dental implants have become a desirable alternative to other methods of replacing missing teeth. Excellent success rates and a range of available options give dentists a variety of new ways to treat and replace lost teeth.</p>

<p>Your dentist can evaluate your case and tell you if you are a candidate for dental implants. Structurally, a dental implant is a titanium-based cylinder that replaces the missing tooth root. After a period of time, other parts are placed on the implant to enable your dentist to eventually place a crown (cap) on the implant. Implants can also be used to support full or partial dentures, dramatically improving denture retention and stability.
</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/dental-implant-dentist-marietta-ga.gif"/></div>
<p>Most patients with adequate bone mass can have implants, although it varies among individuals. Typically an x-ray and CT-scan are performed to determine if you have enough bone to place the implant, as well as to verify the size and kind of implant that should be placed.
Benefits of Dental Implants</p>
<p><strong>1. Better esthetics:</strong></p>

<p>Since implants are placed in the gum similar to the way a natural tooth is supported, they offer a more realistic and natural look compared to other alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>2. Reduction of bone resorption:</strong>
</p>
<p>When a tooth is lost, the supporting bone structure gradually recedes. Placing an implant in that empty space significantly reduces the speed of bone resorption and provides stability for this valuable tissue.</p>
<p><strong>3. Retention:</strong></p>

<p>Patients who have experienced removable full or partial dentures know that keeping their dentures in place is always a challenge. Dental implants offer a great improvement to denture retention for all patients. In some cases the denture can be secured to a group of implants with special screws that stabilize the denture completely.
</p>

<p>Often the preferred method of replacing a single missing tooth is a bridge. Bridges require extra preparation for the surrounding teeth to ultimately connect 3 or more teeth. This negatively impacts your health by making the task of retaining your teeth more difficult and by often requiring the destruction of existing tooth structure to create room for the new bridge. An implant is mostly an independent unit and does not negatively affect the adjacent teeth.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Dental Sealants</h2></div>
				
				
<p> Sealants are thin layers of resin that are placed on the pits, fissures, and grooves of molars to prevent decay on these surfaces.
</p>
<p>The majority of decay on back teeth starts in the grooves and pits of chewing surfaces, especially during the first few years after their eruption. Sealing these surfaces with composite resins prevents this kind of decay.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/Tooth-Sealants.gif"/></div>

<p>Sealants are one of the most effective methods of preventing decay on the surfaces where they are placed. Although it is still a possibility that decay may develop on surfaces in between teeth, sealants significantly reduce the overall chance of having cavities.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Root Canal Treatment</h2></div>
			
			
<p> Every tooth consists of three different layers. The outermost and hardest layer is enamel, and the second layer is dentin. The third is pulp, which is the cavernous space where the live tissue and nerve of each tooth is located.</p>
 	<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/Root-Canal-Procedure.png"/></div>

<p>If for any reason the pulp space is exposed to the outside, the tissue becomes contaminated and eventually infected. The exposure of pulp happens in many circumstances, such as when you have a large cavity or a fractured tooth. Your dentist can explain the exact reason for damage to this tissue. In these cases, the treatment is usually root canal treatment.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Dental X-Ray </h2></div>
								
<p>Dental Radiographs are commonly called x-rays. Dentists use radiographs for many reasons: to find hidden dental structures, malignant or benign masses, bone loss, and cavities.</p>

<p>A radiographic image is formed by a controlled burst of X-ray radiation which penetrates oral structures at different levels, depending on varying anatomical densities, before striking the film or sensor. Teeth appear lighter because less radiation penetrates them to reach the film. Dental caries, infections and other changes in the bone density, and the periodontal ligament, appear darker because X-rays readily penetrate these less dense structures. Dental restorations (fillings, crowns) may appear lighter or darker, depending on the density of the material.
</p>
<p>The dosage of X-ray radiation received by a dental patient is typically small (around 0.150 mSv for a full mouth series, according to the American Dental Association website), equivalent to a few days' worth of background environmental radiation exposure, or similar to the dose received during a cross-country airplane flight (concentrated into one short burst aimed at a small area). Incidental exposure is further reduced by the use of a lead shield, lead apron, sometimes with a lead thyroid collar. Technician exposure is reduced by stepping out of the room, or behind adequate shielding material, when the X-ray source is activated.
</p>
<p>Once photographic film has been exposed to X-ray radiation, it needs to be developed, traditionally using a process where the film is exposed to a series of chemicals in a dark room, as the films are sensitive to normal light. This can be a time-consuming process, and incorrect exposures or mistakes in the development process can necessitate retakes, exposing the patient to additional radiation. Digital x-rays, which replace the film with an electronic sensor, address some of these issues, and are becoming widely used in dentistry as the technology evolves. They may require less radiation and are processed much quicker than conventional radiographic films, often instantly viewable on a computer. However digital sensors are extremely costly and have historically had poor resolution, though this is much improved in modern sensors.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/dental-x-ray.jpg"/></div>
<p>This preoperative photo of tooth #3, (A), reveals no clinically apparent decay other than a small spot within the central fossa. In fact, decay could not be detected with an explorer. Radiographic evaluation, (B), however, revealed an extensive region of demineralization within the dentin (arrows) of the mesial half of the tooth. When a bur was used to remove the occlusal enamel overlying the decay, (C), a large hollow was found within the crown and it was discovered that a hole in the side of the tooth large enough to allow the tip of the explorer to pass was contiguous with this hollow. After all of the decay had been removed, (D), the pulp chamber had been exposed and most of the mesial half of the crown was either missing or poorly supported.</p>

<p>It is possible for both tooth decay and periodontal disease to be missed during a clinical exam, and radiographic evaluation of the dental and periodontal tissues is a critical segment of the comprehensive oral examination. The photographic montage at right depicts a situation in which extensive decay had been overlooked by a number of dentists prior to radiographic evaluation.      </p>

            <div class="title"><h2>TMJ Treatment</h2></div>
				
<p>TMJ is the joint that connects the lower and upper jaw. The term TMJ stands for Temporo-mandibular Joint. This is one of the most complex joints in the entire body, capable of forward and backward movement, rotations, and side-to-side movements. TMJ often refers to complications and problems with this joint. Some of the most common symptoms of TMJ problems are:
</p>
				<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/tmj1.p.jpg"/></div>

<p>1.Pain.</p>

<p>2.Limited movement of the lower jaw.
</p>

<p>4.Muscle spasms.
</p>
<p>5.Locking of the jaw.
</p>
<p>Some potential causes of the disease include genetics, hormones, low-level infections, auto-immune diseases, trauma, and clenching or grinding of the teeth. Diagnosis and evaluation of such conditions are performed by dentists experienced in TMJ problems and treatments. Some common treatments are Night Guards, Bite Guards, and Bite Adjustments. Your dentist can guide you toward the best treatment for you.

            <div class="title"><h2>Overdentures</h2></div>
				
<p>Overdentures are dentures which derive their support from one or abutment teeth by completely enveloping them beneath the fitting surface. The abutment teeth are usually root filled and either simply reduced or used in conjunction with stud or bar precision attachments. For both of these situations two techniques of impression taking are used. When the teeth are already root filled and will later be reduced it is termed an immediate overdenture. An impression of the root filled teeth, prior to reduction, is taken in alginate or elastomer in a special tray. The impression is cast and the abutment teeth on the model are reduced in height by 4mm and the dentures are constructed around this. When the processed denture is fitted, it is relined with cold cured acrylic in the areas around the abutment teeth to make it fit as well as possible.
</p>
				<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/Overdenture.jpg"/></div>


<p>If precision attachments are used the procedure is different. A special tray is used with either impression paste or elastomers depending on the presence of undercuts. The tray has a window over each of the abutments, this ensures any excess material flows out, without displacing any of the tissues. An impression of the abutments is taken, being careful to record postholes. If a stud attachment is used, a plastic stud is placed on the abutment teeth corresponding to the positions where the final attachments will be placed. The impression is taken and poured giving a fairly accurate impression of the ridge with the studs in their intended position. The fitting surface and rest of the denture are carefully constructed around the plastic studs on the model. If a bar attachment is used plastic clips, into which the bar will slot, are placed in the abutment teeth at the correct alignment. An impression is then taken and cast. The bar and rest of denture are then constructed on the model.

            <div class="title"><h2>Orthodontic Treatment</h2></div>
				
<p>Orthodontics is the branch of dentistry that corrects teeth and jaws that are positioned improperly. Crooked teeth and teeth that do not fit together correctly are harder to keep clean, are at risk of being lost early due to tooth decay and periodontal disease, and cause extra stress on the chewing muscles that can lead to headaches, TMJ syndrome and neck, shoulder and back pain. Teeth that are crooked or not in the right place can also detract from one's appearance.
</p>
				<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/Orthodontic Treatment.jpg"/></div>


<p>The benefits of orthodontic treatment include a healthier mouth, a more pleasing appearance, and teeth that are more likely to last a lifetime.
</p>
<p>A specialist in this field is called an orthodontist. Orthodontists receive two or more years of education beyond their four years in dental school in an ADA-approved orthodontic training program.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Periodontic Treatment</h2></div>
				
<p>Periodontics is that specialty of dentistry which encompasses the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the supporting and surrounding tissues of the teeth or their substitutes and the maintenance of the health, function and esthetics of these structures and tissues.
</p>
				<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/Periodontic Treatment.jpg"/></div>


<p>Periodontal diseases take on many different forms but are usually a result of a coalescence of bacterial plaque biofilm accumulation of the red complex bacteria (egs. include P. gingivalis, T. forsythus, and T. denticola) of the gingiva and teeth, combined with host immuno-inflammatory mechanisms and other risk factors which lead to destruction of the supporting bone around natural teeth. Untreated, these diseases lead to alveolar bone loss and tooth loss and, to date, continue to be the leading cause of tooth loss in adults.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Treatment of Broken Jaw & Oral Surgery</h2></div>
				
<p>A broken or dislocated jaw is an injury to the joints that join the lower jawbone to the skull. These joints, called the temporomandibular joints, can break, crack, or become “unhinged” from the skull. The unhinging of the jaw joints is referred to as a dislocation.
Broken, fractured, or dislocated jaws can create problems with eating and breathing. Immediate medical attention is required to minimize complications and accelerate healing.
</p>
				


<p>Pain, swelling, and bleeding are the most immediate symptoms of a broken jaw. Your entire face can swell, making your jaw painful and stiff. Bleeding from the mouth can occur, causing breathing difficulties in some people. The blood flow can block your airways. You may experience the most pain and tenderness when chewing or speaking. During a severe jaw fracture, you might not be able to move your jaw much, if at all.
Numbness and bruising in the face and gums is also normal for a broken or fractured jaw. The breaking of the bone can cause other abnormalities with the shape of your face. You might notice that your jaw or face has a lumpy appearance. The impact of your injury could also cause loosened or lost teeth.</p>

<h2>Oral Surgery</h2>
<p>A number of conditions may require oral surgery, including:</p>

<p><strong>Impacted Teeth</strong></p>

<p>Wisdom teeth, otherwise known as third molars, are the last set of teeth to develop. Sometimes these teeth emerge from the gum line and the jaw is large enough to allow room for them, but most of the time, this is not the case. More often, one or more of these third molars fails to emerge in proper alignment or fails to fully emerge through the gum line and becomes entrapped or "impacted" between the jawbone and the gum tissue. Impacted wisdom teeth can result in swelling, pain, and infection of the gum tissue surrounding the wisdom teeth. In addition, impacted wisdom teeth can cause permanent damage to nearby teeth, gums, and bone and can sometimes lead to the formation of cysts or tumors that can destroy sections of the jaw. Therefore, dentists recommend people with impacted wisdom teeth have them surgically removed.</p>

<p>It's not just wisdom teeth that sometimes become impacted and need to be removed. Other teeth, such as the cuspids and the bicuspids can become impacted and can cause the same types of problems described with impacted wisdom teeth.</p>

<p><strong>Tooth Loss</strong></p>

<p>Dental implants are an option for tooth loss due to an accident or infection or as an alternative to dentures. The implants are tooth root substitutes that are surgically anchored in place in the jawbone and act to stabilize the artificial teeth to which they are attached. Suitable candidates for dental implants need to have an adequate bone level and density, must not be prone to infection, and must be willing to maintain good oral hygiene practices.</p>

<p><strong>Jaw-Related Problems</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unequal jaw growth.</strong>In some individuals, the upper and lower jaws fail to grow properly. This can cause difficulty in speaking, eating, swallowing, and breathing. While some of these problems -- like improper teeth alignment -- can be corrected with braces and other orthodontic appliances, more serious problems require oral surgery to move all or part of the upper jaw, lower jaw, or both into a new position that is more balanced, functional, and healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Improve fit of dentures.</strong> For first-time denture wearers, oral surgery can be done to correct any irregularities of the jaws prior to creating the dentures to ensure a better fit. Oral surgery can also help long-term denture wearers. Supporting bone often deteriorates over time resulting in dentures that no longer fit properly. In severe cases, an oral surgeon can add a bone graft to areas where little bone remains.</p>

<p><strong>Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.</strong> Dysfunction of the TMJ, the small joint in front of the ear where the skull and lower jaw meet, is a common source of headache and facial pain. Most patients with TMJ disorders can be successfully treated with a combination of oral medications, physical therapy, and splints. However, joint surgery is an option for advanced cases and when the diagnosis indicates a specific problem in the joint.</p>

Dentists are also responsible for diagnosing conditions that affect the mouth, teeth, gums and jaws, as well as develop the most effective treatment plan with the patient's best interests in mind.</p>

<p>General dentists typically do not focus on any particular specialty, instead opting to provide generalized dental care to patients. In some cases, general dentists may refer a patient to a specialty provider for care or treatment that is beyond the scope of general dentistry. However, most general dentists are capable of providing complete examinations, cleanings, root canals, restorations, extractions and tooth prosthetics.</p>

<p>General dentistry is best when patients use it for preventive care, rather than for corrective treatment. By visiting a dentist and his or her team of hygienists and dental technicians twice annually for cleaning and examination, patients can avoid decay and identify potential oral health conditions, such as periodontal disease, in their earliest stages.	</p>
