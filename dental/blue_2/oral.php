            <div class="title"><h2>How to Brush Your Teeth</h2></div>
				
				
                <p>The first step is to choose a good toothbrush. You always want to use a soft brush with a small head. A soft brush is hard enough to remove plaque, yet gentle enough not to damage your teeth or gums.</p>

<p>The next issue is to select good toothpaste. In general, any toothpaste that contains Fluoride will do the job, unless you have special needs that are determined by your dentist. Two of the best brands of toothpaste are Colgate Total and Crest Multicare.
</p>

<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/how to brush ur tith.jpg"/></div>

<p>There are a variety of techniques for brushing your teeth, but one of the most popular ones is described here:
</p>
<p>Hold the brush at a 45 degree angle toward the teeth and gums. Gently press against the gums so the tips of the bristles go in between the gum and the teeth. Then apply a few lateral strokes and roll the brush down to sweep the plaque away from the teeth and the gum. Repeat this motion 6 to 10 times and move on to the next area of 2 to 3 teeth. If your mouth is full of foam, spit it out and continue brushing. Your brushing is completed when you have brushed all the surfaces of your teeth, not when your mouth is full! On chewing surfaces, short strokes work best to get the plaque out of the grooves and pits. When brushing the back side of your front teeth, hold your brush vertically to be able to reach the teeth better.
</p>
<p>As far as frequency of brushing is concerned, ideally you want to brush your teeth after each meal. But if you can't, brush at least twice a day - after breakfast and before going to bed.
</p>
            <?php

		case 2:
		{
			?>
            <div class="title"><h2>How to Floss Your Teeth </h2></div>
            The surfaces between teeth are not easily accessible by toothbrush; therefore, the best way to clean them is by flossing. The ideal frequency for flossing is like brushing: ideally after each meal, though one time a day (before going to bed) is the minimum necessary.
            <div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/floss.jpg"/></div>

To start, cut a piece of dental floss (approximately 2 feet). Wrap both sides of the floss around your middle fingers. Using your index and thumb, glide the floss in between all of your teeth one by one. When flossing, make sure you are not cutting your gums. The goal is to clean the teeth surfaces, not the gums. In the space in between the teeth, press the floss against each side of the tooth (hug the tooth) and gently move it back and forth and up and down. Then move to the opposite surface of the adjacent tooth

            <div class="title"><h2>Electric VS Manual Brush</h2></div>
           <p> There have been multiple studies comparing the effectiveness of manual brushes and electric brushes.
</p>
<p>Although not all electric brushes are the same, these studies conclude that, in general, electric brushes are more efficient in controlling plaque than manual brushes. Theoretically, you can do a very good brushing with a regular hand brush, but the movements of an electric brush make the task easier and more effective.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/electric.jpg"/></div>
<p>
Also, some electric brushes (Sonicare) produce sonic vibrations that are difficult to mimic with a hand brush! Other electric brushes like Oral-B and Rotadent have small heads that help you access hard-to-reach areas of your mouth. This aspect is more important when you are talking about someone with orthodontic braces or a history of gum disease.

            <div class="title"><h2>Bad Breath</h2></div>
             <p>There are a few different causes of bad breath. Ranging from stomach problems to diet and teeth problems, most of the causes can be found in the mouth. They are:
</p>
<p>1.Tongue (when bacteria grows in between the papilla).</p>

<p>2.Teeth cavities (especially when food particles get stuck in them).</p>

<p>3.Gum diseases.</p>

<p>4.Extraction sites during healing.</p>

<p>5.Dentures when not cleaned properly.</p>

<p>6.Alcohol and tobacco.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/breath.jpg"/></div>
<p>bad breath treatment in West VancouverIf you or someone you know is concerned about bad breath, the first step is a dental check up. Your dentist will be able to confirm or rule out the source of the bad breath.</p>
<p>When the cause is found, treatment will be determined and explained by your dentist. If the source of the bad breath is your mouth, there is little chance that mouth washes or mints can treat the problem. They usually mask the problem for a short period of time, and can sometimes exacerbate the situation (mouthwashes that contain alcohol cause dry mouth and usually make the bad breath worse).
</p>
<p>These are a few other, non-dental reasons that cause bad breath:</p>

<p>1.Sore throat.</p>

<p>2.Tonsillitis.</p>

<p>3.Some food.</p>

<p>4.Infection of air passages.</p>

<p>Following a good oral hygiene routine and receiving regular dental check ups are the best ways to prevent bad breath.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Dental Health & Your Diet</h2></div>
			
<p>Sugar is the main cause of dental decay when bacteria are present. However, the frequency of your sugar consumption is more significant than the amount of sugar you eat.</p>

<p>Probably the worst thing you can do to your teeth is to drink a soda and have a sip every few minutes over a long period of time; the same is true for snacking. It is recommended that if you want to have a snack, soda, or juice, it is better to have it after food, as dessert, or have it in one sitting. Eating or drinking something sweet over an extended period of time creates a constant supply of sugar for bacteria that causes tooth decay!</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/dite.JPG"/></div>

<p>It is important to be aware of all the possible sources of sugar out there. It is not just everything that is sweet, but anything that can turn to sugar, like pieces of bread. Cutting down your sugar intake is good for cavity prevention, as well as your general health.
</p>
<p>But what about when you have to have sugar? The best way to avoid cavities is to prevent the sugar from staying next to your teeth. Brushing after eating sugar, rinsing your mouth with Fluoride mouth wash, or chewing sugarless gum can help. However, nothing has the effect of avoiding sugar!</p>

<p>Is there any kind of food that prevents tooth decay? Well, not really. Some people believe that chewing foods like apples and carrots may have some plaque removal effects, but they still contain some sugar, so any advantage is not clear.</p>

<p>Another group of food that causes significant damage to teeth structure is acidic food. If in frequent contact with teeth, things like limes, lemons, and grapefruits can cause serious irreversible damage (erosion) to your teeth.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>Fluoride & Decay Prevention</h2></div>
			<p>Many years ago scientists started to notice that children who were born and raised in areas with natural fluoride in drinking water had fewer cavities than children in other areas. Fluoride absorbed by your body when teeth were forming (during mother's pregnancy to early childhood) integrates into the structure of enamel and makes it stronger.</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/PreventingToothDecay04.jpg"/></div>

<p>After teeth eruption, fluoride found in your toothpaste, mouthwash, or in what your dentist places on your teeth still has a positive effect on your teeth. It strengthens the enamel and reduces the chance of tooth decay.</p>

<p>If you have children and live in an area that has no fluoride in its drinking water, you should consult your dentist and physician about fluoride tablets that are available for children.</p>

            <div class="title"><h2>General Dentistry</h2></div>
				<p>General dentistry is the branch of medicine involving the care and prevention of oral health conditions, diseases and disorders. A dentist's job is to use preventative care and patient education to preclude the need for treatments and instead promote a healthy smile for life. Dentists are also responsible for diagnosing conditions that affect the mouth, teeth, gums and jaws, as well as develop the most effective treatment plan with the patient's best interests in mind.</p>
				<div class="thumbnail"><img alt="" src="images/gallery/25.jpg"/></div>
<p>General dentists typically do not focus on any particular specialty, instead opting to provide generalized dental care to patients. In some cases, general dentists may refer a patient to a specialty provider for care or treatment that is beyond the scope of general dentistry. However, most general dentists are capable of providing complete examinations, cleanings, root canals, restorations, extractions and tooth prosthetics.</p>

<p>General dentistry is best when patients use it for preventive care, rather than for corrective treatment. By visiting a dentist and his or her team of hygienists and dental technicians twice annually for cleaning and examination, patients can avoid decay and identify potential oral health conditions, such as periodontal disease, in their earliest stages.	</p>
